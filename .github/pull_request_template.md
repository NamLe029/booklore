## ✅ Pre-Submission Checklist

> **All boxes must be checked before requesting review.** Incomplete PRs will be closed without review, no exceptions.

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines and conventions
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `develop` (merge conflicts resolved)
- [ ] Automated tests added or updated to cover changes (backend **and** frontend)
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`./gradlew test` for backend, `ng test` for frontend)
- [ ] Changes manually verified in local dev environment (including related features)
- [ ] Flyway migration versioning is correct _(if schema was modified)_
- [ ] Documentation PR submitted to [booklore-docs](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore-docs) _(if user-facing changes)_

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Contributions

> **If any part of this PR was generated or assisted by AI tools (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.), all items below are mandatory.** AI-generated code that hasn't been thoroughly reviewed is the leading cause of reverted PRs. You are responsible for every line you submit. "The AI wrote it" is not an excuse.

- [ ] Every line has been read, understood, and can be explained by the author
- [ ] PR is scoped to a single logical change, not a dump of everything the AI suggested
- [ ] Tests validate actual behavior, not just coverage (AI-generated tests often assert nothing meaningful)
- [ ] No dead code, placeholder comments, `TODO`s, or unused scaffolding
